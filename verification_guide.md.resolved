# Local Verification & GitHub Instructions

Follow these steps to verify your system and push your changes to cloud.

## 1. Test FastAPI & Swagger UI

To start your API locally:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Once it's running:
1.  Open your browser to: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
2.  You will see the **Swagger UI**.
3.  Expand the `/chat` POST endpoint, click "Try it out", enter a question, and click "Execute".

## 2. Test MLOps (MLflow & LangSmith)

### MLflow
To start the MLflow tracking server, run this in a **new terminal**:
```bash
mlflow ui --port 5000
```
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to see your experiments.

### LangSmith
Since you've added your API key to [.env](file:///home/gsavaliya/LLMops_Multi_Doc_Chat/.env), every request you make via Swagger UI or the script below will automatically appear in your [LangSmith Dashboard](https://smith.langchain.com/).

### Run Evaluation Script
Run this to see both tools in action:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## 3. Push to GitHub

If you haven't initialized your repository yet:

1.  **Initialize Git**:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
2.  **Add your files**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
3.  **Commit changes**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initialize project with OpenAI, FastAPI, and MLOps"
    ```
4.  **Create a new repository** on [GitHub](https://github.com/new).
5.  **Connect and push**:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

> [!CAUTION]
> Ensure your `.gitignore` includes [.env](file:///home/gsavaliya/LLMops_Multi_Doc_Chat/.env) so you don't leak your OpenAI or LangSmith keys!
